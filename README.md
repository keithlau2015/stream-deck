# üéÆ ConsoleDeck

> **Note**: This is a fork of the original [ConsoleDeck project](https://github.com/LucaDiLorenzo98/cd_v2_script) by [@LucaDiLorenzo98](https://github.com/LucaDiLorenzo98), enhanced with additional features and improvements.

ConsoleDeck is an enhanced version of the original ConsoleDeck - a simple graphical interface that allows you to configure up to 9 buttons to launch websites or executable files with a click.  
Ideal for creating your own customizable macro deck or personal launcher.

## ‚ú® What's New

- **System Tray Integration**: Runs in the background with a system tray icon
- **Enhanced Serial Communication**: Improved Arduino integration with volume control, mute toggle, and media controls
- **Better Configuration Management**: More robust config handling with reload capabilities
- **Improved GUI**: Enhanced user interface with better button states and visual feedback
- **Clipboard Integration**: Support for Ctrl+V to paste URLs and Ctrl+A/C for text selection
- **Background Operation**: Can run without keeping the GUI window open

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- A Windows PC
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Internet connection (only for the initial setup)
- Arduino board (optional, for hardware button support)

## üîß Configuration

### GPIO Configuration (Arduino Settings)
ConsoleDeck now uses a configuration file for Arduino settings.

Edit `gpio_config.json`:
```json
{
    "arduino": {
        "port": "COM7",
        "baudrate": 9600,
        "timeout": 1
    },
    "volume": {
        "enabled": true,
        "default_value": 0
    },
    "media": {
        "enabled": true
    },
    "debug": {
        "enabled": true,
        "log_level": "INFO"
    }
}
```

### Configuration Options
- **Arduino Port**: COM port for Arduino connection (e.g., COM3, COM7)
- **Baud Rate**: Serial communication speed (default: 9600)
- **Serial Timeout**: Connection timeout in seconds
- **Volume Control**: Enable/disable volume and mute controls
- **Media Controls**: Enable/disable media play/pause
- **Debug Logging**: Enable/disable detailed logging

### Button Actions
Each button can be configured with:
- **Type**: `link`, `exe`, or `none`
- **Value**: URL for links, file path for executables

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**üü° Nothing happens when I click a button?**  
Make sure you launched the app using: `python main.py`

**üîó Can I use YouTube or other links?**  
Yes, any valid `https://` link will work.

**üß© Can I assign programs like `.exe` files?**  
Yes! Use the "Browse" button to pick an executable file.

**üíæ It says 'pip' is not recognized**  
Restart your computer or reinstall Python and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is selected during setup.

**üîå Arduino not connecting?**  
Check your COM port in Device Manager and run `python configure_gpio.py` to update your Arduino settings

## üßº How to uninstall

- You can delete the project folder at any time
- To uninstall Python, go to **Apps & Features** in Windows

---

## üì¨ Need help?

If you get stuck or the app doesn't behave as expected:
- Check the original project: [ConsoleDeck Script](https://github.com/LucaDiLorenzo98/cd_v2_script)
- Open an issue on this repository
